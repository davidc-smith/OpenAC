/// <summary>
/// Calls one drawing callback per frame and takes it off the frame when it
/// stops behaving.
///
/// <para>A drawing callback runs inside the interface's own paint, between
/// someone else's push and that someone's matching pop. Two things there are
/// unrecoverable if nobody watches for them. One is time: the callback is on
/// the frame's critical path, so a slow one shows up directly as a lower
/// frame rate with no hint of where it went. The other is the drawing state:
/// the clip rectangle, the alpha and the origin are three stacks, and a
/// callback that pushes without popping shifts, dims or crops everything
/// drawn after it -- anywhere on the screen, with nothing pointing back at
/// the callback.</para>
///
/// <para>So each call is timed, and the three stack depths are read before
/// and compared after. A callback over budget for
/// <see cref="ConsecutiveOverrunsBeforeTrip"/> frames in a row is dropped; a
/// callback that throws or leaves the stacks unbalanced is dropped at once,
/// because either one means it has already stopped doing what it says. A
/// dropped callback is reported once and never called again.</para>
///
/// <para>The depth can be put back; the values cannot. A callback that popped
/// a level belonging to its caller destroyed the clip rectangle or origin
/// that level held, and no one outside knows what it was. What is pushed back
/// in its place is whatever is current after the over-popping: the caller's
/// OUTER clip, which is wider, or no clipping at all if the callback emptied
/// the stack. So the rest of that scope can draw outside the window it
/// belongs to, not merely inside a smaller piece of it -- the damage is
/// content in the wrong place rather than content missing. Restoring the
/// depth keeps the rest of the frame's pushes and pops paired, which is the
/// most that can be salvaged, and since such a callback is dropped on the
/// spot it is at most one frame of it.</para>
